          I’m an aspiring <strong>full-stack engineer</strong> focused on building
          clean, secure, production-ready web systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m currently attending my <strong
            >master’s in computer science</strong
          >. Outside of coursework, I’m deep into <strong>OSINT</strong> +
          <strong>OPSEC</strong>, and I care a lot about <strong>privacy</strong
          > (both for users and for teams).
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve built and maintain my own <strong>homelab</strong>, so I’m
          comfortable shipping and operating services in private environments —
          thinking in terms of least privilege, sane defaults, and tight CSP.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Full-stack web apps (frontend UX + backend APIs)</li>
          <li>Cloudflare Workers + edge patterns</li>
          <li>Security mindset + privacy-first engineering</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For projects, the best starting point is
          <a href="/projects/">/projects/</a> and my highlighted repos on
          <a
            href="https://github.com/n0-tone"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a
          >. For more clarity on my known languages, experience and stack check
          out <a href="/usr/">/usr/</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Recent work includes a chatbot management app (Python/Flask), this
          Cloudflare Workers-powered site with strict CSP + nonce, and homelab
          tooling protected behind Zero Trust.
